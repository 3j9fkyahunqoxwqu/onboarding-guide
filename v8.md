## V8

V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

V8 compiles and executes JavaScript source code, handles memory allocation for objects, and garbage collects objects it no longer needs. V8’s stop-the-world, generational, accurate garbage collector is one of the keys to V8’s performance.

### Key Concepts and Terms

1. An [**`isolate`**](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-0.8/d5/dda/classv8_1_1_isolate.html) is a VM instance with its own heap.
2. A [**`local handle`**](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-0.8/d3/dd5/classv8_1_1_handle.html) is a pointer to an object.
   * All V8 objects are accessed using handles. They are necessary because of the way the V8 garbage collector works.
3. A [**`handle scope`**](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-0.8/d3/d95/classv8_1_1_handle_scope.html) can be thought of as a container for any number of handles.
   * When you've finished with your handles, instead of deleting each one individually you can simply delete their scope.
4. A [**`context`**](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-0.8/df/d69/classv8_1_1_context.html) is an execution environment that allows separate, unrelated, JavaScript code to run in a single instance of V8.
   * You must explicitly specify the context in which you want any JavaScript code to be run.

The V8 API provides functions for compiling and executing scripts, accessing C++ methods and data structures, handling errors, and enabling security checks. Your application can use V8 just like any other C++ library. Your C++ code accesses V8 through the V8 API by including the header `include/v8.h`.

It's highly recommended that you read [this embedding guide](https://v8.dev/docs/embed) as you familiarize yourself with V8's usage in Electron.
